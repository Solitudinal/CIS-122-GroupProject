# Concept
Turn-based RPG that is narrative-driven and focuses on defeating progressively stronger enemies while acquiring new abilities, items, and more powerful stats for your main character.

# Gameplay (core mechanics)
Main mechanic is progressing through the story while intermittently engaging in combat where turns will be taken between main character and enemies. On main character’s turn, player will select from a wide variety of options to strategically defeat the enemies.

Other mechanics involve completing side quests for NPCs, solving puzzles, managing inventory/shopping for items, and making strategic ability choices as main character grows in level.

# Story
(Potentially could be fleshed out with more detail later.)
Setting of the game is MSU Mankato’s campus. Player character progresses through specific departments and places on campus that are themed appropriately. When player defeats the boss enemy of a department or location, they will receive unique powers or abilities that match the theme of that location.

# Interface (control scheme)
Control scheme for movement will be the WASD or arrow keys. The WASD and arrow keys will also be used for all menu navigation. The Enter or F keys will be used for confirming menu selections, interacting with the environment and NPCs, as well as advancing NPC dialogue. The Tab key opens the character menu, and the Q and E keys are used to cycle between character menu submenus to the left and right respectively. The Esc key opens the main menu.

# Art Style 
(Need Jordan and Niel’s help with this section at some point)
Pixelated sprites(?) in 2D environment.

Win/Lose Conditions
The game is completed upon defeating the final boss on campus <Maybe the dean?>. Players get game over if their health is reduced to 0 during combat <potentially will have other ways to die outside of combat, e.g., poison status effect that continues to damage you after combat>.
